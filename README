This is the source distribution of OpenCPI, which is hosted on
github.com.  OpenCPI is Open Source Software, licensed with the LGPL3.
See LICENSE.txt.

This branch is intended to be built from source, used in-place, where
it is downloaded as a git repo from github.com.  The installation is
in a directory of the user's choosing, and makes no global changes to
the user's system other than:

- Installing some required standard packages using the "yum install" or equivalent command.
- Dynamically loading the OpenCPI kernel driver in order to test it.

I.e. multiple versions can be downloaded and coexist, but only one can
be actively using the kernel driver, which is needed to access
OpenCPI-supported FPGA devices on the system's bus.

The installation process is described in detail in a document
described below, but the steps described here are sufficient if you
understand them:

1. Ensure that you have "git" installed on your system.
2. Ensure that you have "sudo" permission on your system.
3. Download the software in a directory of your choosing by running:

   git clone https://github.com/opencpi/opencpi.git
   cd opencpi

   The git command will create an "opencpi" subdirectory containing the software, and after the
   "cd" command, you will be in that new "opencpi" directory.

4. Build and test OpenCPI for use on the system you downloaded to, by running:

   ./scripts/install-opencpi.sh

   This command may take a while, and will require you to provide the sudo password twice
   during that process, for the two "global" actions described earlier.
   If you are not present to provide the password it may fail, but can be rerun.
   It will require internet access to download and build software it needs.
   There are ways around this requirement that are described in the installation guide.

5. Set up your environment as a user of OpenCPI using the "opencpi-setup.sh" script in the
   cdk subdirectory.  OpenCPI currently only supports the "bash" shell.
   There are two ways to perform this step:

   - If you want to manually set up your environment in each shell window as you need it,
     you simple source the script where it lives.  E.g. if OpenCPI was downloaded into the
     ~/opencpi directory, you would issue the command:

     source ~/opencpi/cdk/opencpi-setup.sh -s

   - If you want to set up the environment on each login, you would add this same line to
     your ~/.profile file (or ~/.bash_login or ~/.bash_profile).  Note that this will only
     take effect when you login, or when you start a new "login shell" using the "-l" option
     to bash, like:

     bash -l
