This directory is for autoconf macros that are part of OpenCPI rather than those
imported from elsewhere, which are in the ../imported-macros directory.
Note that autoconf is executed in the gen/ subdirectory, using the acinclude
subdirectory constructed *there*, which is a combination of this directory
and the imported-macros directory.
