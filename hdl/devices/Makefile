# This directory contains a library of device workers.
# It is a lot like the components directory except that all of the workers
# are device specific - each worker controls some piece of hardware on a 
# chip or attached to a chip.  Currently we have no notion of anything but
# hdl device workers, although that could (should?) change.

# The names of the device workers are only qualified when we have more than
# one -- until we have a good naming convension.
#
# Remember that subdevices that support other devices must occur AFTER the devices they support
# Similarly, emulators must occur after the devices they emulate
# TODO / FIXME - add ad9361_config_proxy.rcc to Workers
