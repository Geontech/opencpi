Open Component Portability Infrastructure (OpenCPI)

An open source software (OSS) framework to simplify complexity and enable
code portability of real-time systems

 *   Creates a hardware abstraction layer for embedded real-time systems
 *   Real-time middleware for embedded systems
 *   Middleware for Waveform-Readyâ„¢ Processing Platforms leading to improved
     waveform code portability with standards-based interfaces
 *   Increased interoperability using container technology
 *   Real-time virtualization
 *   Component Portability Infrastructure (CPI) is a real-time embedded (RTE)
     middleware framework that simplifies programming of heterogeneous
     processing applications requiring, in a system or across a tech refresh,
     a mix of processing and interconnect technologies.
