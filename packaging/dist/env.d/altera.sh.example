## Define Altera/Quartus Tool Directories and Versions
##
## If the Quartus Standard tools were not installed in a default location
## of ~/intelFPGA, /opt/intelFPGA, ~/altera or /opt/Altera, define the
## installation location via OCPI_ALTERA_DIR.
## If you have multiple versions in that directory and plan to use one other than
## the most recent, set OCPI_ALTERA_VERSION
export OCPI_ALTERA_DIR=
export OCPI_ALTERA_VERSION=

## If both Quartus Standard AND Pro are installed, or if Quartus Pro is
## installed in a location other than ~/intelFPGA_pro, /opt/intelFPGA_pro,
## ~/altera or /opt/Altera, define the installation location via OCPI_ALTERA_PRO_DIR.
## If you have multiple versions in that directory and plan to use one other than
## the most recent, set OCPI_ALTERA_PRO_VERSION
export OCPI_ALTERA_PRO_DIR=
export OCPI_ALTERA_PRO_VERSION=

## IMPORTANT NOTE: Quartus Standard and Pro Editions cannot be installed in the same
##                 directory for use with OpenCPI. For example, you cannot have versions
##                 of both Standard AND Pro installed in ~/altera. Instead, it is recommended
##                 that you install them in separate directories such as ~/intelFPGA and
##                 ~/intelFPGA_pro.

## Set the location of the license file/server (matching Altera's LM_LICENSE_FILE documentation)
export OCPI_ALTERA_LICENSE_FILE=
