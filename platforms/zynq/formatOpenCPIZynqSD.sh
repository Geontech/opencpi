This script formats an SD card for a Zynq platform.
It should be run with "sudo".
The single argument is the name of the device of the SD card, e.g. /dev/sdb or /dev/mmcblk0
The SD card will be umounted if it is mounted.
You can use "sudo fdisk -l | grep 'Disk /'" to see all disk devices.
You can use "df -h" or "mount" to see what is mounted.
