This directory contains three OpenCPI "Projects". The descriptions below are from a high-level view.

core - This contains the minimum Project needed to experience OpenCPI, e.g. bias.test. It contains:
  * Components and Workers such as file_read and file_write as well as Framework internals
  * RCC (GPP) Platforms such as centos7 and xilinx13_3 (used by most Zynq-based systems)
  * HDL Simulation Platforms such as modelsim and xsim

assets - This is the main library Project provided by the OpenCPI maintainers, containing:
  * Example Applications, e.g. FSK modulation
  * Components and Workers partitioned into various libraries by type, e.g. dsp_comps
  * HDL Platforms such as Epiq's Matchstiq Z1 and Altera's Stratix 4 Development Board (ALST4)

inactive - This Project is the "catch-all" for anything not in the above Projects. This would include Platforms
that are not officially supported (e.g. fedora25 or ML555), Components that have not been fully vetted or are
being retired, etc. Inclusion within this Project is neither an indication that something should be avoided nor
that it is being promoted.
