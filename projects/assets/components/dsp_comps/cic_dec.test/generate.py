CIC Decimator: Generate test input data

Generate args:
1. amplitude of output file (max 16bit signed = 32767)
2. name of output file

Two test cases are used for all of the worker's various configurations:
1. Unity Gain Reponse to DC input (constant value)
2. Tones at 50.0, 100.0 and Fs/R Hz, sampled at 1024000 Hz.
 
Only one critical factor was considered when creating the input test data 
for each test case and the configuration of each worker:
- To create enough input test data such that the worker outputted 
multiple data messages (8192 bytes) and the total amount of output data
was large enough to perform quality FFTs for each worker configuration.
