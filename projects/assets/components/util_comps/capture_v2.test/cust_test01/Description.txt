Test capture worker with output not connected. Use the run_test.sh script to generate the input data, build the hdl assembly,
run the app for the test, and verify the output. The run_test.sh script requires the argument of numDataWords, the size of the data property
for the current worker build configuration to pass to the generate.py script and requires the name of the hdl platform to build
the custom test for, as an argument.
