The DRS Picoflexor T6A uses CodeSourcery's distribution of the GCC compiler suite. However, the default
install does not include the Boost libraries. The VM image provided by DRS for Picoflexor development
has the required headers and libraries. To install them, copy out of the VM the following files and
place them in the same place on your local machine:

/opt/CodeSourcery/Sourcery_G++_Lite/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/usr/lib/libboost*.a (various files)
/opt/CodeSourcery/Sourcery_G++_Lite/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/usr/include/boost (directory)
