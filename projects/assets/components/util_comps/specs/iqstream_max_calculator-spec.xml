<!-- max_I_is_valid    Indicates max_I is valid. Will be false if no data has
                       been received on in port since either a) the last read of
                       max_I or b) the worker first went into the operating
                       state.
     max_Q_is_valid    Indicates max_Q is valid. Will be false if no data has
                       been received on in port since either a) the last read of
                       max_I or b) the worker first went into the operating
                       state.
     max_I             Max I value observed on in port. Value will be -32768 
                       when worker first enters the operating state and will be
                       reset to -32768 after each read. max_I_is_valid should
                       always be read prior to reading this property because
                       max_I_is_valid will immediately be set to false once
                       max_I is read.
     max_Q             Max Q value observed on in port. Value will be -32768 
                       when worker first enters the operating state and will be
                       reset to -32768 after each read. max_Q_is_valid should
                       always be read prior to reading this property because
                       max_I_is_valid will immediately be set to false once
                       max_Q is read.
