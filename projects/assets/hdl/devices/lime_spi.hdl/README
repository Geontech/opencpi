This device worker is a submodule shared by the lime rx and tx workers.
It is required when one or both of the lime_rx and lime_tx workers are instanced.

It serves three purposes:

1. To drive the common reset (from either control reset in rawprops ports)
2. To receive the receive data clock that may be used by the transmit side
   as a clocking option
3. To share the single SPI interface for raw property acccess
