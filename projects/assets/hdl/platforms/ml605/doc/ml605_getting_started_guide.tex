\section*{ML605 Getting Started Guide}
\subsection*{Hardware Prerequisites}
This section describes the hardware prerequisites required for an operational Xilinx Virtex-6 ML605 platform using OpenCPI. Note that the slot configurations in Table \ref{table:supported_slots} are limited by what FPGA bitstreams are currently built by OpenCPI and not by what hardware configurations are theoretically possible using OpenCPI.\\ \\
Hardware prerequisites are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item An ML605 board, which has undergone an OpenCPI-specific initial one-time hardware setup \cite{ml605_hardware_setup} and is plugged into a PCIE slot of an x86 computer.
\item Optionally, one of the following FMC card configurations in Table  \ref{table:supported_slots} may exist
\end{itemize}

                \cline{2-3}

                \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ } & & transceiver card \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Software Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item A CentOS 6 or CentOS 7 operating system installed on the x86 computer.
\item Xilinx ISE installed on the x86 computer, including the necessary Xilinx cable driver modifications necessary for CentOS. For information on these modifications, refer to \cite{fpga_vendor_tool_guide}
\item OpenCPI framework and prerequisite RPMs installed on the x86 computer. For more information refer to \cite{rpm_installation_guide}
\item OpenCPI Base Project compiled for ml605. For more information refer to the "Base Project" section in \cite{rpm_installation_guide}
\item OpenCPI assets project compiled for ml605. For more information refer to the "OpenCPI assets Project" section in \cite{rpm_installation_guide}

\subsection*{Proof of Operation}
The following commands may be run in order to verify correct OpenCPI operation on the x86/ML605 system.\\ \\
Existence of ML605 RCC/HDL containers may be verified by running the following command and verifying that similar output is produced.\\
\noindent\terminaloutput{\$ ocpirun -C\\
Available containers:\\
 \#  Model\hspace{6ex} Platform\hspace{3ex}    OS\hspace{5ex}     OS-Version\hspace{1ex}  Arch\hspace{3ex} Name\\
 0  hdl\hspace{9ex}   ml605\hspace{39ex} PCI:0000:02:00.0\\
 1  rcc\hspace{9ex}   centos7\hspace{4ex}      linux\hspace{2ex}  c7\hspace{10ex}          x86\_64\hspace{1ex} rcc0\\
}\\ \\
Operation of the RCC container can be verified by running the hello application via the following command and verifying that identical output is produced. Note that the OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable must be setup correctly for your system prior to running this command.\\
\noindent\terminaloutput{\$ ocpirun -t 1 \$OCPI\_PROJECT\_PATH/examples/xml/hello.xml \\
Hello, world} \\ \\
Simultaneous RCC/HDL container operation can be verified by running the testbias application via the following command and verifying that identical output is produced. Note that the OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable must be setup correctly for your system prior to running this command.\\

\subsection*{Known Issues}
\subsubsection*{Single Port of Data from CPU to FPGA} % AV-3783
\label{bug:3783}
The current implementations of the PCI-e Specification on the this platform only correctly implements data flow from the CPU to the FPGA under certain configurations which must be met when defining new Assemblies:
\begin{itemize}
\item At most a single data port with CPU-to-FPGA data flow. Port connection must also be one of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item defined in a single-worker Assembly XML using the worker ``\texttt{Externals='true'}'' attribute/value and the DefaultContainer used (DefaultContainer not defined in Assembly Makefile), or
\item the first External Assembly Connection defined in the Assembly XML and the DefaultContainer used, or
\item the first Interconnect Container Connection defined in a Container XML (Default Container must be disabled via ``\texttt{DefaultContainer=}'' in the Assembly Makefile).
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Note that this applies to the TX/DAC data path connections for bitstreams with transceiver transmit data flow from a CPU (e.g. RCC worker to FPGA TX/DAC data path). See \path{projects/assets/hdl/assemblies/empty/cnt_1rx_1tx_bypassasm_fmcomms_2_3_lpc_LVDS_ml605.xml} as an example.
