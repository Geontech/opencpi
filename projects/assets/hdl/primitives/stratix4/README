This primitive library is for code that is specific to stratix4, but that does not get
IMPLICITLY used for workers built for stratix4 targets. Modules that get IMPLICITLY
used in workers built for stratix4 belong in the util_stratix4 or vendor_altera libraries.

Code goes here that is shared by different stratix4-based platforms, and those
platforms will EXPLICITLY reference this library.
