This directory contains information about cards.
The specs directory contains:
1. slot type definitions
2. card definition files, which define individual cards
   -- refer to slot definitions (which type of slot this card plugs into)
      in hdl/plaforms/specs
   -- define which devices are on the cards, refering to device workers that are found
      either in hdl/devices, or here in hdl/cards.
   -- non-standard signal names between the platform FPGA and the slots, otherwise it is assumed
      that these signals follow the pattern: <slotname>_<std_signa_name>

3. device workers that are only found on cards and are not already in hdl/cards.
