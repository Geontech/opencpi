This is a library of device workers.
The specs subdirectory is for when there is a separate spec file for a device worker (when more than one implementation exists for the same high level interface).
The scripts subdirectory is for scripts related to this library.
Otherwide its just device workers, and the result is produced in the "lib" subdirectory.
RCC implementations here are for dummy software standins for devices, usually based on file I/O.
