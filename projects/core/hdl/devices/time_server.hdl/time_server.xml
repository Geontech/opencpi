  <!-- Difference between last-written value and timeNow (now - written value),
       computed and stored when this register was last written
       Used to compute access round trip time, by software doing:
       1. Read timeNow
       2. Write timeDelta
       3. Read timeDelta
       The value is the time delta between when Step one occurred at the time service (t0),
       and when step 2 occurred at the time service (t1). -->

  <!-- Control of time service - writable with readback
       Bit 31:   clearSticky   - Clear the sticky status bits (ppsLost, gpsIn, ppsIn, timeset)
       Bit  4:   disableServo  - Suppress discipline of local timebase by CP, PPS, or GPS
       Bit  3:   disableGPS    - disable updates from GPS
       Bit  2:   disablePPS    - disable processing PPS inputs
       Bit  1:0  controlPPSOut - 0: output is timeserver-based PPS (1 HZ)
                                 1: output is copy of input PPS (with some propagation delay)
                                 2: output is local reference clock /2 (e.g. 100MHz for 200Mhz)
				 3: output is disabled (0) -->

  <!-- Status of time service - readonly, volatile
       Bit 31:   ppsLost    - An active PPS fell outside the +/- 0.1% (1000 PPM) window
       Bit 30:   gpsIn      - At least one valid GPS time has updated timeNow
       Bit 29:   ppsIn      - At least one valie PPS input has aligned timeNow
       Bit 28:   timeSet    - timeNow has been set from the control plane
       Bit 27:   ppsOK      - PPS fell within the valid window in the last second
       Bit 26:   ppsLost    - PPS went missing from the valid window in the last second
       Bit  7:0: ppsCount   - count of PPS events, rolling 8 bits -->
