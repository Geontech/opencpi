This directory (in any project) is for OpenCPI runtime platforms, whether development-capable
platforms or embedded runtime-only platforms.  The name of each subdirectory is a unique name
for the platform.  The contents of each directory is a set of platform specific
files and scripts, and is thus the home for platform specific "stuff".

There are a few standard files that are expected to be in each platform subdirectory:

README:                    describes the platform
<platform>-packages.sh:    an optional script to download and install packages from the
                           standard repository for the OS, only for development platforms
<platform>-check.sh:       A script to verify you are running on this platform for dev platforms
                           Only for development platforms
<platform>.mk:             Settings for self hosted building on development platforms.

If any platform-specific prerequisites are mentioned in the <platform>.mk file, then for each
one there should exist a script:
install-<prerequisite>.sh

Thus adding a platform requires at least these steps:

1. Add a directory here with the files mentioned above, and a README file describing it
2. Ensuring that there is compilation (or cross-compilation) support for the target.
   Perhaps creating a tool chain prerequisite installation script here.
3. If needed for a development platform, add a "<platform>-packages.sh" script to the directory.
4. For a development platform add the "<platform>-check.sh" script.
5. Add the "<platform>.mk" files to the directory.
6. Once getPlatform.sh works on the the development platform
   the following scripts should execute (at the top level):
     ./scripts/install-packages.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/build-opencpi.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/test-opencpi.sh <platform>
   All these scripts take an optional <platform> argument.
   The test-opencpi.sh will not run on cross-platforms.
   The scripts/install-opencpi.sh runs all 4 scripts, and also takes a platform argument.
