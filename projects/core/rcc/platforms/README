This directory (in any project) is for OpenCPI runtime platforms, whether development-capable
platforms or embedded runtime-only platforms.  The name of each subdirectory is a unique name
for the platform.  The contents of each directory is a set of platform specific
files and scripts, and is thus the home for platform specific "stuff".

There are a few standard files that are expected to be in each platform subdirectory:

README:                    describes the platform
target:                    a one line file containing the compilation target for the platform.
                           E.g. for centos6: linux-c6-x86_64.
<platform>-prerequisites:  A one line list of platform-specific prerequisites to install,
                           E.g. tool chains.
<platform>-packages.sh:    an optional script to download and install packages from the
                           standard repository for the OS, only for development platforms
<platform>-target.mk:      Makefile settings for building the OpenCPI framework for this platform
<platform>-check.sh:       A script to verify you are running on this platform for dev platforms
                           Only for development platforms
rcc=<dev-platform>=<platform>.mk:
                           Settings for cross-building from dev-platform to platform
rcc=<platform>.mk:         Settings for self hosted building on development platforms.

Thus adding a platform requires at least these steps:

1. Add a directory here with the files mentioned above, and a README file describing it
2. Ensuring that there is compilation (or cross-compilation) support for the target.
   Perhaps creating a tool chain installation script here.
3. If needed for a development platform, add a "<platform>-packages.sh" script to the directory.
4. For a development platform add the "<platform>-check.sh" script.
5. Add the "target" and "<platform>-target.mk" files to the directory.
6. For building RCC workers, for local/native/host-based compilation, add the file:
     rcc=<platform>.mk
   and for RCC worker cross-compilation file, building on <devhost>, add the file:
     rcc=<devhost>=<platform>.mk
7. Once getPlatform.sh works on the the development platform
   the following scripts should execute (at the top level):
     ./scripts/install-packages.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/build-opencpi.sh <platform>
     ./scripts/test-opencpi.sh <platform>
   All these scripts take an optional <platform> argument.
   The test-opencpi.sh will not run on cross-platforms.
   The scripts/install-opencpi.sh runs all 4 scripts, and also takes a platform argument.
