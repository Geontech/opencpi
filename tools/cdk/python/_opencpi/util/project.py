    Given an origin path, noun, name  and location/library directives,
    determine the target assets's directory to work in.

    Basically, the arguments of this function describe the current state/location in a project
    as well as a description of where to look for an asset of a certain name and type.
    This function completes that mapping of:
    'current-state/location + asset-description' -> asset-directory,
    and returns the working directory of interest.

    First, this function converts the current state/location to location/library directives
    like library, hdl_library, hdl_platform and collection_type. So basically, convert the
    current-state + location-directives, to just location-directives. These location-directives
    along with descriptors like noun and name comprise an asset-description.

    At that point, the _get_asset_dir() function can be called which converts an asset-description
    to asset-directory. This nested function call does not require any current-state/location
    information, and will provide the location of the target asset relative to a project top.

    Finally, the path to the project of interest is prepended to this asset-directory and
    the resulting full-path is returned.

    Args:
        origin_path: path from which we are operating - this provides runtime context that may
                     translate to location directives:
                         (library/hdl_library/hdl_platform/collection_type)
        noun: noun/asset-type of interest. Defaults to blank
        name: name of the asset to locate. Basically, what is the name of the asset of type <noun>
        library: the library in which the asset of interest lives
        hdl_library: the HDL library in which the asset of interest lives (in the hdl/ subtree)
        hdl_platform: the HDL platform in which the asset of interest lives.
                      might itself be the asset

    Return:
        asset_dir: the full path to asset described via this function's arguments

    Notes:
        name and noun describe the name and type of asset being described.
        The library, platform arguments are location-directives or modifiers

    Given a noun, a name, and library directives
    determine the target asset's directory from a project top.

    Basically, the arguments of this function specify/describe an asset in a project.
    This function completes that mapping of asset-description -> asset-directory,
    and returns the directory of interest relative to the top of the project.

    Args:
        noun: noun/asset-type of interest. Defaults to blank
        name: name of the asset to locate. Basically, what is the name of the asset of type <noun>
        library: the library in which the asset of interest lives
        hdl_library: the HDL library in which the asset of interest lives (in the hdl/ subtree)
        hdl_platform: the HDL platform in which the asset of interest lives.
                      might itself be the asset

    Return:
        asset: the project subdirectory containing the asset described via this function's arguments

    Notes:
        name and noun describe the name and type of asset being described.
        The library and platform arguments are location-directives or modifiers
        that dictate where to the asset is found.
