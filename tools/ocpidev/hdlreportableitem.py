    ReportableItem

    A key/name of an item to be reported with an associated regular expression(s).
    This regex(s) is used to search files for a value or some information corresponding to the item.
    Regex(s) are split up into those for synthesis reporting (synth_regexs), and those for
    implementation reporting (impl_regexs). Each one (synth/impl_regexs) can either be a single
    regular expression, a list of regular expressions, or a dictionary mapping keys to regular
    expressions. This description is expanded on in the match_* functions of this class.

    Calling <thisreportableitem>.match_and_transform_synth(target_file) will search for the
    synth regex(s) in the target_file and return the results. The method for performing this search
    can be specified (for synth and/or impl) via the match_and_transform_*_function
    arguments, or the following default function will be used:
        ocpiutil.match_regex - find regex in file and return the first match group
    Other options:
        ocpiutil.match_regex_get_first_num - find regex in file and return the first number in
                                             that string
        Other options: ocpiutil.match_regex_get_first_num_freq - find regex in file, return the
                                                                 first number in the string
                                                                 converted from period in ns to
                                                                 freq in MHz
                       custom functions - user defined named or anonymous functions for parsing
                                          a file for a regular expression and returning the result

    Example (doctest):
        # Here, we create a reportable item named "Item0" with a regex that matches
        # the following line:
        # This text right here contains a number (2.000ns)!!!! It should match item0's regex
        # We then call match_and_transform_synth() and give it this current file as the argument.
        # It should find that line and parse out the first number it finds:
        >>> item0 = ReportableItem("Item0", "#.*This text right.*\((.*)ns\)!!!!.*")
        >>> item0.match_and_transform_synth(os.path.realpath(__file__))
        '2.000'

        # Next, we override the default match_and_transform_synth_function with a function
        # from a period to a frequency.
        >>> item1 = ReportableItem("Item0", "#.*This text right.*!!!!.*",\
                                   match_and_transform_synth_function=\
                                       ocpiutil.match_regex_get_first_num_freq)
        >>> item1.match_and_transform_synth(os.path.realpath(__file__))
